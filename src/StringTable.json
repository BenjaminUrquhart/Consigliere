A frigid, chilling wind whipped through, carrying with it an eerie green smoke containing a deep sickness. Town members were held up in their homes, lethargic, and on the brink of death. The Witch stood over the town frustrated.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t how this is supposed to go. This town has taken so much from me, I am supposed to be the one to end it!\u201c shouted the Witch from the mouth of the Coven\u2019s cave.\nHelena approached the Witch. \u201cYou will get your revenge. We will make sure of that.\u201d\n\u201cThank you Helena,\u201d said the Witch, turning to address the Coven. \u201cNow, do any of you know who is this being spreading this disease, or what kind of sorcery is being wrought?\u201d\nBakt the Necromancer, Nikki the Potion Master, Helena the Hexmaster, Medusa the Gorgon, and Kande the Poisoner looked around uneasily. No one knew who or what the being was, but it was obviously powerful considering how easily it had plunged the whole town into disease.\n\u201cIf we are going to battle this being, we need more power on our side,\u201d said the Witch.\nA speck of snow landed on the tip of the Witch\u2019s nose, sparking an idea. The Witch rushed into the cave and began rummaging around. Nikki asked, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d said the Witch, pulling out what appeared to be a petrified branch encased in ice. \u201cThis is exactly what we need.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Medusa.\n\u201cIt is an ancient relic as old as Earth, and it will give us all the extra help that we need. One of my past Coven members gave it to me as an incentive to join the Coven. I knew it would be useful one day,\u201d grinned the Witch. \u201cGather round and channel your energies into the ice with me. We need to melt it and a normal fire will not do.\u201d\nNikki and Kande worked together to prepare a magic-enhancing potion for the others to drink, while the Witch, Helena, Bakt, and Medusa channeled magic into the ice. The Witch's power forced its way into the stone, while Helena\u2019s magic covered the outside of the ice. Bakt\u2019s magic seeped up from the ground and grabbed hold of the ice. Medusa\u2019s magic flowed in a blinding light from the snakes encircling her head. The ice started to shimmer as the Witch cackled. \u201cKeep focusing your magic into the ice!\u201d\nAs the ice melted, the wind picked up and clouds formed overhead. The snow started to fall faster and heavier, swirling around the witches feet before being carried off by the wind. Before long the witches were at the center of a snowy tornado.\nFrom the corner of her eye, the Witch saw a shadowy figure walking towards them. The figure parted the snow easily and reached for the branch. \u201cGive me that, you cretins. You have no idea what you are doing with it!\u201d The figure snatched the branch, and as he did so, his shadowy shaper resolved before the witches as an old man with pale blue skin and snow white hair, clad in a robe.\n\u201cDo you know what you have done! You have disrupted the natural order!\u201d exclaimed the old man.\n\u201cWe know what this means, but we need your help, Jack,\u201d said the Witch calmly.\nHelena gasped. \u201cJack? Jack Frost?\u201d\n\u201cThe Spirit of Winter,\u201d the old man confirmed. \u201cNow, you willingly upset the balance of the seasons? By releasing my relic you have swayed the seasons in favor of Winter and upset the other spirits,\u201d scolded Jack.\n\u201cWhatever that means, we will deal with it later. We need your help to defeat someone. A being whose powers are unknown to us, and quite powerful,\u201d says the Witch.\n\u201cLater? I don\u2019t think you understand the gravity of the situation. In ancient times the seasonal spirits almost tore the world apart fighting over which one of us would be left to rule. When the world--and each of us---were on the brink of death we all agreed to seal away our relics of power and rule together. Now we each take our time to see our perfect vision of the world,\u201d explained Jack.\n\u201cWe can reseal the relic, but first we need your help. As I said, there is someone we need your help to defeat. Someone more powerful than anyone I have ever seen before. This being carries a lantern that spewed green smoke down onto Salem, causing sickness and disease to spread. I can not allow these people to die by his hands. Those towns members took everything from me, and I will be the one to take everything from them,\u201d the Witch said savagely.\n\u201cWhat? A lantern with green smoke? This can\u2019t be what I think it is,\u201d Jack said worriedly.\nThe witch's eyes widened. \u201cYou know who this is? Tell us so that we can defeat it.\u201d\n\u201cIf I am not mistaken, this is the work of the Plaguebearer. He is a fell man whose only goal is to spread disease among as many people as possible. This Plaguebearer has lived for as long as I can remember, and is rumored to be something even more terrifying,\u201d trembled Jack. \u201cWe need to deal with this, and fast. I will help you, and once this is over, you will return my relic to the ice.\u201d\n\u201cIf you are this worried, then we should go now,\u201d pressured the Witch.\nJack looked around at the other Coven members, assessing whether their combined might would be enough. With no time to waste, he agreed to join the witches as they set out towards the source of the green smoke.\nThe group trudged through Salem, looking this way and that. People were stumbling around, lethargic and coughing. Caught up in their own misery, none of the townspeople reacted to them at all. Throughout Salem every soul was infected.\nIn the distance beyond the town, they could see smoke pouring out of the forest. As the Coven and Jack Frost approachd the edge of the forest, the smoke became heavier, thicker, and more toxic. Bakt began to cough violently, and everyone turned towards her. Bakt's skin was paler than normal, and she appeared a bit sluggish.\n\u201cNikki, Kande, what is wrong with her?\u201d asked the Witch.\n\u201cThe smoke, it is affecting her. We will take care of this.\u201d Nikki and Kande worked together to create a concoction to help Bakt, and then they continued on their way.\nThey entered the forest and each member began to feel the effects of the smoke. Nikki distributed the rest of the concoction to the party to help protect them from the effects of the smoke.\nFrom deep in the forest they could hear a horse neighing. The group pushed forward toward the sound of the horse, passing through the trees, and shortly found themselves at a hut. Tied up outside the hut was a pale, sickly horse standing next to a festering trough infested with all manner of insects and algae. From the hut billowed green smoke, and the trees in the area decayed before the group\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cAre we ready?\u201d whispered the Witch.\nThe party glanced around and each other and all nodded. Drawing himself to his full height, Jack summoned forth a winter blast of wind that blew the door to the hut off its hinges. Inside, next to the chimney, sat the Plaguebearer, stoking the fire. The Plaguebearer glanced up at the group briefly, and barely paying them any attention turned back to the fire.\nThe Witch was puzzled and infuriated by the Plaguebearer\u2019s nonchalant attitude after having his door blown off its hinges.\n\u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d shouted the Witch. \u201cSalem is my town to destroy, and I will not let you snatch it out from under me, do you hear me?\u201d\nThe Plaguebearer continued to stoke the fire, ignoring the angry witch and her group.\n\u201cLook at me, you toad!\u201d screeched the Witch, hurling a spell at the Plaguebearer.\nThe spell smashed into the Plaguebearer, but barely caused his jacket to ruffle. The Plaguebearer stood slowly and turned to the Witch. He stared at her, not saying anything. His gaze pierced through the Witch\u2019s soul like a dagger through the heart.\nThe Witch stepped back a pace, uneasy and wary of the Plaguebearer. She looked back at the rest of the group and said, \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there! Get him!\u201d\nJack waved his relic towards the door. The ice and snow piled up around the entrance swirled together into a humanoid shape. He waved the ice elemental towards the Plaguebearer while Bakt summoned hands that began to form and reach up from the floors. The elemental reared back to punch the Plaguebearer, but just before the punch landed, the Plaguebearer reached into the elemental's chest and it crumbled to pieces. The hands reaching up from the ground latched onto the legs of the Plaguebearer, holding him in place. Nikki reached into her coat and pulled out a vial that she threw at the Plaguebearer.  It shattered upon his shoulder, releasing a liquid that steamed and bubbled. The Plaguebearer didn't make a sound, but he grabbed his shoulder in pain.\n\u201cWhat is he?\u201d shouted Medusa.\n\u201cJust keep attacking!\u201d screamed the Witch as she hurled a ball of light towards the Plaguebearer.\nThe Plaguebearer was bleeding now, but he didn't appear noticeably concerned. He calmly wiped the blood off with his coat. He picked up his lantern and a flash of green light blinded the group. When their vision returned, they could see that the hands that had been holding the Plaguebearer had dissipated, and he was holding Medusa by the throat as her feet dangled above the ground.\n\u201cMedusa!\u201d shouted the Coven.\nThe Plaguebearer\u2019s eyes darted towards the remainder of the group, then back to Medusa. He tighened his grip on Medusa\u2019s throat. She tried to scream, but the grip on her throat was so tight she could not even manage a squeak.\nJack summoned another icy blast of wind that swept the Plaguebearer off of his feet, causing him to release Medusa. Medusa quickly slithered back to the group, rubbing her raw neck.\nAs the Plaguebearer stood back up, the Witch noticed that the smoke from his lantern was not as thick as before, and its effects on her seemed to be lessening, although they were all very weak, even Jack, from the smoke and the effort of casting spells.\nAn idea came to the Witch. It would be all or nothing. \u201cJack, hold him off for us. I have an idea, it might be just enough for us to win this!\u201d said the Witch. \u201cEveryone else, channel the remainder of your magic into me.\u201d\nJack summoned three more ice elementals to help stall the Plaguebearer. The Plaguebearer slowly stepped forward, challenging Jack. Jack motioned his elementals in and threw a spear of ice towards the Plaguebearer. The Plaguebearer tried to deflect the spear, but it seemed as though his movements were slower than normal, and the spear grazed his side. As the Plaguebearer  looked down to check his wound, one of the elementals caught the side of his face with a punch. The blow staggered the Plaguebearer, but as another elemental reached for him, the Plaguebearer grabbed its face and slammed it into the wall, shattering it.\nWhile the Plaguebearer was distracted by the ice elementals, the Coven members continued to channel their powers into the Witch. The power emanated from her in bright sparks as she began casting a spell.\n\u201cJust a little longer, Jack!\u201d the Witch cried.\nThe Plaguebearer dispatched another elemental with a swift attack to its chest, but stumbled back from the force of the attack. Jack saw the opening and hurled another spear, this time piercing the Plaguebearer's leg. The last elemental rushed forward and landed a kick that sent the Plaguebearer flying into the wall. Another green light flashed in the hut. As the light faded, this time it was Jack that was in trouble. The Plaguebearer had Jack pinned to the ground, and he was beaten and bloodied.\nJack croaked painfully as he looked over at them, \u201cNow is just as good a time as any, witches\".\nThe Plaguebearer looked their way and tried to jump back, but it was too late. The Witch unleashed a powerful blast of magic that blew her back into the wall behind her. When the dust settled there was a gaping hole in the wall where the Plaguebearer had stood.\nThe Witch stepped up to the hole, peering around for the Plaguebearer. There was a puddle of bloodstained snow where the Plaguebearer had landed after the blast. In the distance, she could see him fleeing atop his horse. The smoke began to clear from the forest as he rode off. The Witch could feel her strength beginning to return.\n\u201cI think it is over. I think we won,\u201d sighed the Witch with relief.\nWhen the group returned to their cave, the Witch turned to Jack and thanked him for his help. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done this without you. I know you didn\u2019t want to get involved.\u201d\n\u201cThe Plaguebearer seems to be injured, and I doubt he will be coming back anytime soon. Just know that I won\u2019t be coming back to help you again. Prepare for his return, and prepare for the worst when he does,\u201d warned Jack Frost.\nThe Coven placed their hands on Jack\u2019s staff and began to channel their magic. Jack, using his own magic, blew on the staff with his icy breath, encasing it in ice once again. Then, with a slight smile, he turned to snow and drifted away on the wind.\n<\/align><\/line-indent><align=center><b><size=110%>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022<\/size><\/b><\/align>"},"GUI_LOBBY_16_DESCRIPTION":{"text":"A corrupt investigator who gathers information for the Mafia."},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_COVEN":{"text":"Coven"},"GUI_FRIENDS_REFERRALS_EXPLAINER_TEXT":{"text":"Congratulations!\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  You have unlocked the ability to invite your friends to play for free!"},"GUI_WHO_DIED_REASON19_2":{"text":"was assaulted by a %role%."},"GUI_WHO_DIED_REASON19_1":{"text":"was also assaulted by a %role%."},"GUI_LOBBY_5_ABILITY":{"text":"This role has the ability to watch someone at night.

NEGOTIATIONS, BINDING ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW\n\nA. <u>Negotiations.<\/u> Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (\u201cClaim\u201d), you and BlankMediaGames agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days (except those Claims expressly excluded in Section XV.F below). BlankMediaGames will send its notice to the address it has on file to the extent that you have provided additional contact information to BlankMediaGames (e.g. by participating in a promotion or survey, or contacting a customer services representative). Otherwise, BlankMediaGames will send its notice to the email address associated with your Account. You will send your notice to BlankMediaGames LLC, 9900 Spectrum Drive, Austin, TX 78717. Please note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim.\n\nB. <u>Binding Arbitration.<\/u> If the parties fail to resolve a Claim through negotiations, within such thirty (30)-day period, either you or BlankMediaGames may elect to have the Claim (except as otherwise provided in Section XV.F) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d) and, where appropriate, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\u201cAAA Consumer Rules\u201d) that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. Both the AAA Rules and the AAA Consumer Rules can be found at the AAA website, www.adr.org. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section XV.B and either the AAA Rules or the AAA Consumer Rules, the terms in this Section XV.B will control and prevail.\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in Section XV.F, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and BlankMediaGames will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator\u2019s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator\u2019s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator\u2019s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and BlankMediaGames may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator\u2019s decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.\n\nBY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND BlankMediaGames ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\n\nC. <u>Arbitration Fees.<\/u> If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by the AAA Rules for initiating the arbitration. Your share of all other fees and costs of the arbitration, including your share of arbitrator compensation, will be charged pursuant to the AAA Rules, and where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. Where your share of the costs is deemed to be excessive by the arbitrator, BlankMediaGames will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.\n\nD. <u>Location.<\/u> The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify BlankMediaGames in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of BlankMediaGames\u2019 arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Austin, Texas, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in Austin, Texas, United States of America, and you and BlankMediaGames agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.\n\nE. <u>Limitations.<\/u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between BlankMediaGames and you individually. YOU AND BlankMediaGames AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.\n\nF. <u>Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration.<\/u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or BlankMediaGames\u2019 intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts\u2019 jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.\n\nG. <u>Governing Law.<\/u> Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Game from outside of the United States. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (the \u201cAct\u201d) may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, New Zealand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Act applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this Agreement.\n\nH. <u>Severability.<\/u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that if any portion this Section XV is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section XV.F), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section XV.F is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor BlankMediaGames will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section XV.F found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Austin, State of Texas, United States of America, and you and BlankMediaGames agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court."},"GUI_ROLE_ABILITY_VERB_9":{"text":"Interrogate"},"GUI_ROLE_ABILITY_VERB_8":{"text":"Resurrect"},"GUI_ROLE_29_TARGETING_X1_SELF":{"text":"You have decided to put on a bulletproof vest tonight."},"GUI_ROLE_ABILITY_VERB_7":{"text":"Seance"},"GUI_ROLE_ABILITY_VERB_6":{"text":"Reveal"},"GUI_PARTY_GAME_MODE_FAIL":{"text":"^Invalid game mode selected:"},"ITEM_25_3":{"text":"Celebrate"},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_32":{"text":"-You have a mystical barrier that grants you %GUI_ROLE_CARD_BASIC_DEFENSE% defense until you are attacked.\n-You will know the role of the player you %GUI_ROLE_CARD_CONTROL%."},"ITEM_25_2":{"text":"RIP"},"ITEM_25_1":{"text":"Accursed"},"ITEM_25_0":{"text":"Defiled"},"ITEM_25_5":{"text":"Sucked Dry"},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_30":{"text":"-Vampires vote at night to bite a target.\n-The youngest Vampire will visit the target at night."},"ITEM_25_4":{"text":"Winter Wonder"},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_31":{"text":"-You will %GUI_ROLE_CARD_RAMPAGE% at a player's house when you attack.\n-If you do not select a target you will stay home and %GUI_ROLE_CARD_RAMPAGE% at your home."},"GUI_MODE_CUSTOM":{"text":"Custom"},"GUI_DISAGREE":{"text":"Disagree"},"GUI_STEAMLINK_WELCOME":{"text":"Hey there, Steam user!"},"GUI_ROLE_9_TARGETING_X2":{"text":"You instead decide to interrogate %target% tonight."},"GUI_ROLE_9_TARGETING_X1":{"text":"You have decided to interrogate %target% tonight."},"GUI_SETTINGS_CLASSIC_SKINS_CHECKBOX":{"text":"Show Classic Skins Only"},"GUI_LOBBY_5_DESCRIPTION":{"text":"An eagle-eyed observer, stealthily camping outside houses to gain information."},"GUI_SCROLL_SELECTION_SCROLLS":{"text":"Equipped Scrolls"},"GUI_THEME_FULL":{"text":"Theme"},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_21":{"text":"-If there is a Mafioso he will attack the target instead of you.\n-You will appear to be innocent to the Sheriff.\n-You can talk with the other Mafia at night."},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_PURGE_TOOLTIP":{"text":"Purge removes all harmful effects from a player."},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_22":{"text":"-If your target dies their role and last will won't be revealed to the Town.\n-Only you will see the cleaned targets role and last will.\n-You may only perform 3 cleanings."},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_23":{"text":"-You can attack if the Godfather doesn't give you orders.\n-If the Godfather dies you will become the next Godfather.\n-You can talk with the other Mafia at night."},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_24":{"text":"-When you choose a role it will be revealed to all the players in the game."},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_20":{"text":"-If your target is investigated they will appear suspicious.\n-If there are no kill capable Mafia roles left you will become a Mafioso."},"GUI_PLAY_NOW":{"text":"Play Now"},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_29":{"text":"-Putting on a bulletproof vest gives you %GUI_ROLE_CARD_BASIC_DEFENSE% defense.\n-You can only use the bulletproof vest 4 times."},"GUI_PROMOTION_028_TITLE":{"text":"Unholy Beginnings"},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_25":{"text":"-Select yourself to ignite doused people dealing an %GUI_ROLE_CARD_UNSTOPPABLE_ATTACK% attack.\n-You will douse anybody that visits you.\n-If you take no action, you will attempt to clean gasoline off yourself."},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_26":{"text":"-Your target is %name%.\n-If your target is killed at night you will become a Jester."},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_27":{"text":"-If you are lynched you will attack one of your guilty or abstaining voters the following night with an %GUI_ROLE_CARD_UNSTOPPABLE_ATTACK% attack."},"GUI_ROLE_CARD_ATTRIBUTE_28":{"text":"-If you are role blocked you will attack the role blocker in addition to your target.\n-Role blockers that target you will have their last will covered in blood making it unreadable.\n-You can choose to be cautious and not kill role blockers."},"GUI_REPORT_REASON":{"text":"Reason"},"GUI_ROLE_39_COLORED":{"text":"<color=#DD0000>Mafia<\/color><color=#1D7CF2>Support<\/color>"},"GUI_ROLE_73_COLORED":{"text":"<color=#CCCCCC>Neutral<\/color><color=#1D7CF2>Evil<\/color>"},"GUI_REVEAL_TOOLTIP":{"text":"Reveal"},"GUI_SWITCH_TO_CLASSIC":{"text":"Switch To Classic"},"GUI_VIGILANTICS_SUMMARY":{"text":"Vigilante vs Witch chaos."},"GUI_PIRATE_DUEL_RESULTS_A22":{"text":"Arr!

To help you celebrate All Hallows\u2019 Eve, we\u2019ve added some new Halloween-themed cosmetics to the shop and Cauldron. Even better, we\u2019ve loaded up your goodie bag by making both the Ambusher and Hypnotist roles available to play in Classic games. Oh, and here\u2019s a fistful of Mafia buffs, including changes to Disguiser, Forger, and Framer. But let\u2019s not stop there\u2026we\u2019ve also brought back Player Statistics and Leaderboards. On top of that, the Witch whispered in our ear that Ranked Season IV has ended, and Ranked Season V is being lined up for the near future. The full list of treats for this release can be found below.\n\n<b>SEASON IV RANKED REWARDS<\/b><u>Bronze<\/u>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>1,000 Merit Points<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>Bronze Lobby Icon<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>3 of each of the following taunts: Celebrate, RIP, Accursed, Defiled, Winter Wonder, Sucked Dry<\/indent><u>Silver<\/u>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>2,000 Merit Points<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>Silver Lobby Icon<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>3 of each of the following taunts: Celebrate, RIP, Accursed, Defiled, Winter Wonder, Sucked Dry<\/indent><u>Gold<\/u>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>3,000 Merit Points<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>Gold Lobby Icon<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>3 of each of the following taunts: Celebrate, RIP, Accursed, Defiled, Winter Wonder, Sucked Dry<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>The Golden House<\/indent><u>Platinum<\/u>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>4,000 Merit Points<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>Platinum Lobby Icon<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>3 of each of the following taunts: Celebrate, RIP, Accursed, Defiled, Winter Wonder, Sucked Dry<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>The Golden House<\/indent><u>Diamond<\/u>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>5,000 Merit Points<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>Diamond Lobby Icon<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>3 of each of the following taunts: Celebrate, RIP, Accursed, Defiled, Winter Wonder, Sucked Dry<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>The Golden House<\/indent><u>Master<\/u>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>6,000 Merit Points<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>Master Lobby Icon<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>3 of each of the following taunts: Celebrate, RIP, Accursed, Defiled, Winter Wonder, Sucked Dry<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%>The Golden House<\/indent><b><u>New Features<\/u><\/b>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Login:<\/b> Halloween-themed login background art and music for the holiday.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Home:<\/b> Added the Player Statistics and Leaderboards browser.<\/indent><b><u>Improvements<\/u><\/b>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Role Change - Disguiser:<\/b> The Disguiser has been updated to not only allow changing their own investigative results, but to also allow them to change the investigative results of their Mafia allies. The game no longer shows the disguised role on the player\u2019s death, but now instead changes Lookout results to show the Mafia visit as being a visit from another player being disguised as. Example: the Disguiser disguises player A as player B, player A visits player C, the Lookout watches player C, the Lookout sees player B (not Player A) visiting player C. This means Lookout results are no longer 100% trustworthy. The Disguiser being able to visit Mafia members also means that the Spy seeing Mafia visits doesn\u2019t automatically confirm someone as non-Mafia anymore since the Spy will see the Disguiser visiting their Mafia teammate.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Role Change - Forger:<\/b> The ability to have false information displayed in the graveyard has been removed from the Disguiser, but the Forger has now gained that ability! Now when you forge a player you are able to select the role you would like that player to show up as in the graveyard. This should help players more easily make believable wills. We believe that misinformation is more powerful than removing information, so this ability has had its available number of uses capped at two.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Role Change - Framer:<\/b> Frames will now last until an investigative role targets the framed player, not just the night the player is framed.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Game:<\/b> The Ambusher and Hypnotist roles have escaped the Coven Expansion and are now available for play in ANY mode whose role list supports them, including Ranked.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Transitions:<\/b> New \"Please wait...\" overlays at various points in the game to prevent user interaction when certain transitions are occurring, such as leaving a party or lobby, quitting a game, logging out, etc.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Cosmetics:<\/b> We\u2019ve added some new Halloween-themed pets and a house.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Taunts:<\/b> New bats-themed taunt. Additionally, the Celebrate! taunt fireworks animation has been improved to be more visible in game.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Login:<\/b> The feedback provided to player\u2019s when they attempt to set a password that doesn\u2019t meet the minimum requirements has been improved and clarified.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Home:<\/b> For our mobile platforms, we\u2019ve added labels to the Navigation icons for clarity.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Lobby:<\/b> The Custom Lobby role summary for Lookout has been updated to include a reference about the new limit of spotting 3 people.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Lobby:<\/b> The Custom Lobby role summary for Jester has been updated to indicate abstaining voters are also susceptible to being haunted.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Game:<\/b> The role card in game will no longer hide the role description text after death. Instead, the role card will be tinted red and display a Tombstone image behind the text to indicate death. This is especially helpful for roles that still have abilities after death, such as the Medium.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Game:<\/b> The Trapper\u2019s Trap Set icon will now display on the player where the trap has been set, instead of on the Trapper themself.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Game:<\/b> For our non-mobile platforms, the game will now zoom in on executions that occur after a guilty verdict has been rendered.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Game:<\/b> Added dazzle animation over center stage when moving to Last Words phase to reduce jarring transition of gallows disappearing, etc.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Game:<\/b> Due to the Disguiser buff, two of the Disguiser\u2019s achievements have been updated. Slippery Chameleon is now awarded when you disguise the same person three times in a single game. Master of Deceit is now awarded the first time you deceive the Town with a disguise as is considered a shadow achievement, so you won\u2019t know you\u2019ve earned it until the end of the game.

The full list of changes for this release can be found below.\n\n<b><u>Improvements<\/u><\/b>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Game (Mobile):<\/b> Implemented in-place targeting ability buttons to speed up mobile targeting and reduce taps needed to successfully vote or target your victim.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Game (Non-mobile):<\/b> The chat log filter dropdown has been expanded to show the entire 15 players in the game to eliminate the need to scroll through the dropdown.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Game - Serial Killer Buff:<\/b> The SK has been buffed so that their attacks will now penetrate role blocks, killing not only the target but also the blocker. The blocker\u2019s Last Will will be bloodied and no longer legible. However, the SK also now has a special ability called Cautious which allows the SK to choose NOT to kill any role blockers. Note that Jailor and Pirate are considered super role blocks, so target penetration does not work against them. However, you can still choose to spare their lives using Cautious.<\/indent>\n\u2022 <indent=3%><b>Game - Arsonist Douse Buff:<\/b> The Arsonist now has enhanced powers.
